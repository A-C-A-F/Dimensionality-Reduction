# Dimensionality-Reduction
Dimensionality Reduction using an Autoencoder in Python

In this project, we will introduce the theory behind an autoencoder (AE), its uses, and its advantages over PCA, a common dimensionality reduction technique.

__Data Source:__ We will use the *make_blobs* function from sklearn.dataset to create our own dataset.

### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1.	How to create a dummy dataset of high dimensionality, and reduce its dimensionality using PCA.
2.	How an autoencoder works, and how it is essentially a nuanced neural network.
3.	How to design, train, and evaluate an encoder from a trained autoencoder with scikit-learn.

### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ An introduction to the problem, as well as a summary of the imports we will need
- __Task 2:__ Dataset creation and preprocessing relevant for our tasks
- __Task 3:__ Using PCA as a baseline for model performance
- __Task 4:__ Theory behind the autoencoder architecture, and how to train a model like this in scikit-learn
- __Task 5:__ Reducing dimensionality using the encoder half of an autoencoder within scikit-learn
